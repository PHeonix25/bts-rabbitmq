# bts-rabbitmq
A repo for my demo for the upcoming Behind the Scenes event about stuff going offline :)

## Goals
We want to demo Polly in use when the following events occur:

1. Services going down/network going offline
2. Storage disappearing
3. Dependency unavailable (RabbitMQ/Raven?)

## AppVeyor
